# STAT-414-Project

## What I did:
#### Eric
I think the merge is complete. We have two new data files: 

1. `final_data.csv` is data on each athlete, with NA values included for each of the EV's we are considering. We can use this file to do some more cleaning if we decide to omit or include any of the EV's.
n = 2294

2. `final_data_noNA.csv` is the data on each athlete with NA values omitted. We will probably end up using this file for EDA.
n = 1536


#### Nick


## To do next:
Now we need to merge this file (`track_data.csv`) with the file containing each athlete's height, weight, sex, and age. This file is named `track_medalists.csv`.

This merge will be pretty difficult, or near impossible because there are so many different names and they are spelled/formatted differently in the two data sets. Also, most are not English names so there are weird characters in there.
