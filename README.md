# STAT-414-Project

## What I did:
I merged much of the data. we now have a file containing infor on each medalist to compete in the olympics as well as their country's population and gdp for that year. File name is track_data.csv.

## To do:
Now we need to merge this file (track_data.csv) with the file containing each athlete's height, weight, sex, and age. This file is named track_medalists.csv.
