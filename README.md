# STAT-414-Project

## What I did:
#### Eric
I think the merge is complete. We have two new data files: 

1. `final_data.csv` is data on each athlete, with NA values included for each of the EV's we are considering. We can use this file to do some more cleaning if we decide to omit or include any of the EV's.
n = 2294

2. `final_data_noNA.csv` is the data on each athlete with NA values omitted. We will probably end up using this file for EDA.
n = 1536

## To do next:
Start the EDA
