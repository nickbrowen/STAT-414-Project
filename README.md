# STAT-414-Project

## What I did:
#### Eric
I merged much of the data. we now have a file containing infor on each medalist to compete in the olympics as well as their country's population and gdp for that year. File name is `track_data.csv`.

Note that gdp data only goes up to 2013. We could either try to find data on 2013 - present or we could just filter out all years after 2013. I'd be happy to just take out the years after 2013 once we start analysis.


#### Nick


## To do next:
Now we need to merge this file (`track_data.csv`) with the file containing each athlete's height, weight, sex, and age. This file is named `track_medalists.csv`.

This merge will be pretty difficult, or near impossible because there are so many different names and they are spelled/formatted differently in the two data sets. Also, most are not English names so there are weird characters in there.
