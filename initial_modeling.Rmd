ICC = 40.88261/(48.82788+40.88261) = 0.456
45.6% of the variation in finishing times is due to country-to-country variation. If we randomly selected two athletes from the same country, their finishing times would be 45.6% correlated.

Intercept: The average finishing time of an athlete from the average country is 7.052 minutes.
